## parametric_stellarator
Parametric 3D CAD modeling tool for stellarator fusion devices. This toolset takes VMEC plasma equilibrium data to build intra-magnet components of varying thickness from a user-specified radial build, as well as corresponding coil filament point-locus data to build magnet coils of user-specified cross-section.
